## codeQuiz is a javascript-enabled quiz that was built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

This code quiz displays questions to the user and accepts input that is then used to determine a final score.

There are three pages that are displayed during the course of the codeQuiz execution.

The three pages are: Main Quiz, User Score Result, and Final Saved Score.

The pages are dynamically generated using HTML DOM elements and Javascript functions.

The quiz also features a timer that will count down from 60 to 0. This timer will automatically end the quiz when it reaches 0. It is also used to determine the user's score result. The user can also save their score result to a final score page and also clear their score if they want.
